### Hej 👋

im Sandro and im learning to Code 💻. I usually program in Java or Kotlin,
which I am now relatively confident with. 
I am currently learning web development, but mainly backend.
besides school, i program plugins for a Minecraft server with 
friends 🧙‍♂️ and volunteer in IT at the child protection association in my city 🧒🏻.
Also check out the [SimpleTimer Plugin](https://github.com/sandrpp/SimpleTimer) if you
